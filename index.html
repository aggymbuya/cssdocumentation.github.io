    <p><strong> CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)</strong> is used to style and layout web pages — for example, to alter the font, colour, size and spacing of your content, split it into multiple columns, or add animations and other decorative features. This module gets you started on the path to CSS mastery with the basics of how it works, including selectors and properties, writing CSS rules, applying CSS to HTML, how to specify length, colour, and other units in CSS, cascade and inheritance, and debugging CSS. </p></header>

<section class="maincontent" id="CSS_Overview">
             
<br> A document is usually a text file structured using a markup language — HTML is the most common markup language, but you will also come across other markup languages such as SVG or XML.

<br>Presenting a document to a user means converting it into a usable form for your audience. Browsers, like Firefox, Chrome or Internet Explorer, are designed to present documents visually, for example, on a computer screen, projector or printer.              

<section class="main-section" id="css_work"> 
<header><h1>How CSS Works</h1></header>     
<p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) allows you to create great looking web pages, but how does it work under the hood? This article explains what CSS is, how the browser turns HTML into a Document Object Model (DOM), how CSS is applied to parts of the DOM, some very basic syntax examples, and what code is used to actually include our CSS in our web page.</p>
            
<h2>How does CSS affect HTML?</h2>
<p>Web browsers apply CSS rules to a document to affect how they are displayed. A CSS rule is formed from:

<br>A set of properties, which have values set to update how the HTML content is displayed, for example, I want my element's width to be 50% of its parent element, and its background to be red.
<br> A selector, which selects the element(s) you want to apply the updated property values to. For example, I want to apply my CSS rule to all the paragraphs in my HTML document.
A set of CSS rules contained within a stylesheet determines how a webpage should look. You will learn a lot more about what CSS syntax looks like in the next article of the module — CSS Syntax.</p>    
          
<h2 id="css_example">A quick CSS example</h2>   
The above descriptions may or may not have made sense, so let's make sure things are clear by presenting a quick example. First of all, let's take a simple HTML document, containing an h1 and a p (notice that a stylesheet is applied to the HTML using a element)
    
<xmp> 
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>My CSS experiment</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello World!</h1>
    <p>This is my first CSS example</p>
  </body>
</html>        
</xmp>       
<br> Lets look at the below Simple CSS example:
<xmp>
    h1 {
  color: blue;
  background-color: yellow;
  border: 1px solid black;
}

p {
  color: red;
}
</xmp>
<p>The first rule starts with an h1 selector, which means that it will apply its property values to the element. It contains three properties and their values (each property/value pair is called a declaration):       

<br>The first one sets the text color to blue.The second sets the background color to yellow. The third one puts a border around the header that is 1 pixel wide, solid (not dotted, or dashed, etc.), and colored black.
<br>The second rule starts with a p selector, which means that it will apply its property values to the paragragh element. It contains one declaration, which sets the text color to red.

<br>In a web browser, the code above would produce the following output:  </p>     
            
<p> When a browser displays a document, it must combine the document's content with its style information. It processes the document in two stages:

<br>The browser converts HTML and CSS into the DOM (Document Object Model). The DOM represents the document in the computer's memory. It combines the document's content with its style.
<br>The browser displays the contents of the DOM  
</section> 
    
<section class="main-doc" id="css_syntax">     
<header><h1>CSS Syntax</h1></header>
<p> Next up, we dive into CSS syntax in a lot more detail, looking at how properties and their values form into declarations, multiple declarations form into declaration blocks, and declaration blocks and selectors form into complete CSS rules. We round off the article by looking at other CSS syntax features such as comments and whitespace. 
<br>A touch of vocabulary
At its most basic level, CSS consists of two building blocks:
<br><strong>Properties:</strong> Human-readable identifiers that indicate which stylistic features (e.g. font, width, background color) you want to change. </p> 

<strong>Values:</strong> Each specified property is given a value, which indicates how you want to change those stylistic features (e.g. what you want to change the font, width or background color to.)
    
<p>A property paired with a value is called a <strong style="color: red;">CSS declaration</strong>. CSS declarations are put within CSS Declaration Blocks. And finally, CSS declaration blocks are paired with selectors to produce CSS Rulesets (or CSS Rules).

<br>Before getting too deep in theory and written explanation, let's look at a concrete example (we saw something very similar in our previous article.)        
</p> 
    
<xmp>
 <!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>My CSS experiment</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello World!</h1>
    <p>This is my first CSS example</p>

    <ul>
      <li>This is</li>
      <li>a list</li>
    </ul>
  </body>
</html>   
</xmp>    
<br> And the CSS file as below;
<xmp>
 h1 {
  colour: blue;
  background-color: yellow;
  border: 1px solid black;
}

p {
  color: red;
}

p, li {
  text-decoration: underline;
}    
</xmp>

</section>                
<section class="main-section" id="selector_introduction">   
 <header><h1>Selector Introduction</h1></header>
<p>CSS selectors and rules
We are missing one part of the puzzle — we need to discuss how to tell our declaration blocks which elements they should be applied to. This is done by prefixing each declaration block with a selector — a pattern that matches some elements on the page. The associated declarations will be applied to those elements only. The selector plus the declaration block is called a ruleset, or often simply just a rule.</p>
<p> Different types of selectors
<ol>Selectors can be divided into the following categories:

<li><strong>Simple selectors:</strong> Match one or more elements based on element type, class, or id.</li>
<li><strong>Attribute selectors:</strong> Match one or more elements based on their attributes/attribute values.</li>
<li><strong>Pseudo-classes:</strong> Match one or more elements that exist in a certain state, such as an element that is being hovered over by the mouse pointer, or a checkbox that is currently disabled or checked, or an element that is the first child of its parent in the DOM tree.</li>
<li><strong>Pseudo-elements:</strong> Match one or more parts of content that are in a certain position in relation to an element, for example the first word of each paragraph, or generated content appearing just before an element.</li>
<li><strong>Combinators:</strong> These are not exactly selectors themselves, but ways of combining two or more selectors in useful ways for very specific selections. So for example, you could select only paragraphs that are direct descendants of divs, or paragraphs that come directly after headings.</li>
<li><strong>Multiple selectors:</strong> Again, these are not separate selectors; the idea is that you can put multiple selectors on the same CSS rule, separated by commas, to apply a single set of declarations to all the elements selected by those selectors.</li>
    </ul> </p> 
     
</section> 
     
<section class="main-section" id="different_selectors_to_use">
    <header><h1>Different Selectors to Use</h1></header>
<p> Class selectors
    The class selector consists of a dot, '.', followed by a class name. A class name is any value, without spaces, placed within an HTML class attribute. It is up to you to choose a name for the class. It is also noteworthy that multiple elements in a document can have the same class value, and a single element can have multiple class names separated by white space. Here's a quick example:</p>
Here is some HTML:
<xmp>
<p>What color do you like?</p>
<div>I like blue.</div>
<p>I prefer BLACK!</p>
</xmp>
and a simple style sheet;
<xmp>
/* All p elements are red */
p {
  color: red;
}

/* All div elements are blue */
div {
  color: blue;
}
</xmp>
            
 <h2 id="id_selector">ID selectors</h2>
<p>The ID selector consists of a hash/pound symbol (#), followed by the ID name of a given element. Any element can have a unique ID name set with the id attribute. It is up to you to choose an ID name. It's the most efficient way to select a single element.

<br>Important: An ID name must be unique in the document. Behaviors regarding duplicated IDs are unpredictable. For example, in some browsers, only the first instance is counted, and the rest are ignored.

Let's look at a quick example — here is some HTML:</p>
<xmp>
<p id="polite"> — "Good morning."</p>
<p id="rude"> — "Go away!"</p>
</xmp>
A simple style sheet:
<xmp>
   #polite {
  font-family: cursive;
}
   #rude {
  font-family: monospace;
  text-transform: uppercase;
}       
</xmp>    
 
<h2 id="universal_selector">Universal Selectors</h2>    
<p> The universal selector (*) is the ultimate joker. It allows selecting all elements on a page. As it is rarely used to apply a style to every element on a page, it is often used in combination with other selectors (see Combinators.)

<br>Important: Take care when using the universal selector. As it applies to all elements, using it in large web pages can have a perceptible impact on performance: web pages display slower than expected. There are not many instances where you'd use this selector.

Now for an example; first some HTML:</p>
 
<h2 id="attribute_selector">Attribute Selectors</h2>
<p> Attribute selectors are a special kind of selector that will match elements based on their attributes and attribute values. Their generic syntax consists of square brackets ([]) containing an attribute name followed by an optional condition to match against the value of the attribute. 
<br>Attribute selectors can be divided into two categories depending on the way they match attribute values: Presence and value attribute selectors and Substring value attribute selectors.</p>

 <h3>Presence and value attribute selectors</h3>
<p>These attribute selectors try to match an exact attribute value:
<ul> 
<li><strong>[attr] :</strong> This selector will select all elements with the attribute attr, whatever its value.</li>
<li><strong>[attr=val] :</strong> This selector will select all elements with the attribute attr, but only if its value is val.</li>
<li><strong>[attr~=val]:</strong> This selector will select all elements with the attribute attr, but only if  val is one of a space-separated list of words contained in attr's value. </li>
</ul>
Let's look at an example featuring the following HTML snippet:</p> 
<xmp>
Ingredients for my recipe: <i lang="fr-FR">Poulet basquaise</i>
<ul>
  <li data-quantity="1kg" data-vegetable>Tomatoes</li>
  <li data-quantity="3" data-vegetable>Onions</li>
  <li data-quantity="3" data-vegetable>Garlic</li>
  <li data-quantity="700g" data-vegetable="not chili">Pepper</li>
  <li data-quantity="2kg" data-meat>Chicken</li>
  <li data-quantity="optional 150g" data-meat>Bacon bits</li>
  <li data-quantity="optional 10ml" data-vegetable="liquid">Olive 
      oil</li>
  <li data-quantity="25cl" data-vegetable="liquid">White wine</li>
</ul>
</xmp>
And a simple style sheet:
<xmp>
/* All elements with the attribute "data-vegetable"
   are given green text */
[data-vegetable] {
  color: green;
}

/* All elements with the attribute "data-vegetable"
   with the exact value "liquid" are given a golden
   background color */
[data-vegetable="liquid"] {
  background-color: goldenrod;
}

/* All elements with the attribute "data-vegetable",
   containing the value "spicy", even among others,
   are given a red text color */
[data-vegetable~="spicy"] {
  color: red;
}
</xmp>
</section> 
            
<section class="main-section" id="pseudo_class">
 <header><h1>CSS Pseudo-Class</h1></header>          
<p> A CSS pseudo-class is a keyword added to the end of a selector, preceded by a colon (:), which is used to specify that you want to style the selected element but only when it is in a certain state. For example, you might want to style a link element only when it is being hovered over by the mouse pointer, or a checkbox when it is disabled or checked, or an element that is the first child of its parent in the DOM tree.</p>
    
<br>We will not dig into every pseudo-class right now, it is not the objective of the Learning Area to teach you everything in exhaustive detail. You'll certainly come across some of these in more detail later, where appropriate.

<h3 id="a_pseudo_class_example">A pseudo-class example</h3>
 For now, let's just see a simple example of how to use these. First, an HTML snippet:
<xmp>
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/" target="_blank">
    Mozilla Developer Network</a>
</xmp>
Then, some <strong>CSS rules:</strong>
<xmp>
/* These styles will style our link
   in all states */
a {
  color: blue;
  font-weight: bold;
}

/* We want visited links to be the same color
   as non visited links */
a:visited {
  color: blue;
}

/* We highlight the link when it is
   hovered over (mouse over), activated (mouse down)
   or focused (keyboard) */
a:hover,
a:active,
a:focus {
  color: darkred;
  text-decoration: none;
}
</xmp>
<h2 id="pseudo_element">Pseudo-Elements</h2>   
Pseudo-elements are very much like pseudo-classes, but they have differences. They are keywords, this time preceded by two colons (::), that can be added to the end of selectors to select a certain part of an element.
<ul>
<li>::after</li>
<li>::before</li>
<li>::selection</li>
<li>::backdrop</li>
</ul>
They all have some very specific behaviors and interesting features, but digging into them all in detail is beyond our scope for now.</p>

<h3>A pseudo-element example</h3>
Here we'll just show a simple CSS example that selects the space just after all absolute links and adds an arrow in that space:
<xmp>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/CSS">
      CSS</a> defined in the MDN glossary.</li>
  <li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/HTML">
      HTML</a> defined in the MDN glossary.</li>
</ul>
</xmp>
Let's add this CSS rule:
<xmp>
/* All elements with an attribute "href" with values
   starting with "http" will have an arrow added after their
   content (to indicate they are external links) */
[href^=http]::after {
  content: '⤴';
}       
</xmp>      
</section>             
            
<section class="main-section" id="css_values"> 
<header><h1>CSS Values</h1></header>
<p> There are many types of CSS property values to consider, from numerical values to colors to functions that perform a certain action (like embedding a background image, or rotating an element.) Some of these rely on particular units for specifying the exact values they are representing — do you want your box to be 30 pixels wide, or 30 centimeters, or 30 em? In this guide, we look at more common values like length, color, and simple functions, as well as exploring less common units like degrees, and even unitless numerical values.</p>
            
<p> There are many value types in CSS, some of them very common and some of them that you'll rarely come across. We won't cover all of them exhaustively in this article; just the ones that you are likely to find most useful as you continue on your path towards mastering CSS. In this article we will cover the following CSS values:
<br><ol>
<li>Numeric values: Length values for specifying e.g. element width, border thickness, or font size, and unitless integers for specifying e.g. relative line width or number of times to run an animation.</li>
<li>Percentages: Can also be used to specify size or length — relative to a parent container's width or height for example, or the default font-size. These are often to facilitate responsive design (e.g. creating "liquid layouts", which automatically adjust to fit on different screen sizes).</li>
<li>Colors: For specifying background colors, text colors, etc.</li>
<li>Functions: For specifying e.g. background images or background image gradients.</li></ol>
You'll also see examples of such units in use all the way through the rest of the CSS topic, and just about every other CSS resource you see! You'll get used to it all in no time.   

<br><strong>Note:</strong> You can find exhaustive coverage of CSS units in the CSS Reference; the units are the entries surrounded by angle brackets, for example <color>.

<h2 id="numeric">Numeric values</h2>
<p>You'll see numbers used in many places in CSS units. This section discusses the most common classes of number value.</p>

<h2>Length and size</h2>
<p>You'll use length/size units (see <length> for reference) all the time in your CSS for layouts, typography and more. Let's look at a simple example — first the HTML:</p>
    
<h2 id="unitless">Unitless values</h2>
<p>You'll sometimes come across unitless numeric values in CSS — this is not always an error, in fact, it is perfectly allowed in some circumstances. For example, if you want to completely remove the margin or padding from an element, you can just use unitless 0 — 0 is 0, no matter what units were set before!</p>
margin: 0;
<h3>Unitless line height</h3>
Another example is line-height, which sets how high each line of text in an element is. You can use units to set a specific line height, but it is often easier to use a unitless value, which acts as a simple multiplying factor. For example, take the following HTML:                
<h2 id="percentages">Percentages</h2>
<p>You can also use percentage values to specify most things that can be specified by specific numeric values. This allows us to create, for example, boxes whose width will always shift to be a certain percentage of their parent container's width. This can be compared to boxes that have their width set to a certain unit value (like px or em), which will always stay the same length, even if their parent container's width changes.

<br>Let's show an example to explain this.

<br>First, two similar boxes, marked up in HTML:</p>
                
<h2 id="color">Colors</h2>
<p>There are many ways to specify color in CSS, some of which are more recently implemented than others. The same color values can be used everywhere in CSS, whether you are specifying text color, background color, or whatever else.

<br>The standard color system available in modern computers is 24 bit, which allows the display of about 16.7 million distinct colors via a combination of different red, green and blue channels with 256 different values per channel  (256 x 256 x 256 = 16,777,216.)

<br>Let's run through the different available types of color value. </p>

<strong>Note:</strong>To convert between the different color systems discussed below, you'll need a color converter. There are lots of easy converters findable online, such as HSL to RGB / RGB to HSL / Hex Colour Converter.

<h3>Keywords</h3>
<p>The simplest, oldest color types in CSS are the color keywords. These are specific strings representing particular color values. For example, the following code:</p>
                
<h3>Hexadecimal values</h3>
<p>The next ubiquitous color system is hexadecimal colors, or hex codes. Each hex value consists of a hash/pound symbol (#) followed by six hexadecimal numbers, each of which can take a value between 0 and f (which represents 15) — so 0123456789abcdef. Each pair of values represents one of the channels — red, green and blue — and allows us to specify any of the 256 available values for each (16 x 16 = 256.)  

So, for example, this code:</p>
<h3 id="rgb">RGB</h3>
<p>The third scheme we'll talk about here is RGB. An RGB value is a function — rgb() — which is given three parameters that represent the red, green and blue channel values of the colors, in much the same way as hex values. The difference with RGB is that each channel is represented not by two hex digits, but by a decimal number between 0 and 255.
Let's rewrite our last example to use RGB colors:</p>

<h3 id="hsl">HSL</h3>
<p>Slightly less well supported than RGB is the HSL model (not on old versions of IE), which was implemented after much interest from designers — instead of red, green and blue values, the hsl() function accepts hue, saturation, and lightness values, which are used to distinguish between the 16.7 million colors, but in a different way:
<ol type="i">
<li><strong>hue:</strong> the base shade of the color. This takes a value between 0 and 360, presenting the angles round a color wheel.</li>
<li><strong>saturation:</strong> how saturated is the color? This takes a value from 0-100%, where 0 is no color (it will appear as a shade of grey), and 100% is full color saturation</li>
<li><strong>lightness:</strong> how light or bright is the color? This takes a value from 0-100%, where 0 is no light (it will appear completely black) and 100% is full light (it will appear completely white)</li>
    </ol>
<br><strong>Note:</strong> An HSL cylinder is useful for visualising the way this color model works. See the HSL and HSV article on Wikipedia.

Now we'll rewrite our example to use HSL colors:
<br> The HSL color model is intuitive to designers that are used to working with such color models. It is useful for, for example, finding a set of shades to go together in a monochrome color scheme:</p>
<h3 id="rgba">RGBA and HSLA</h3>
<p>RGB and HSL both have corresponding modes — RGBA and HSLA — that allow you to set not only what color you want to display, but also what transparency you want that color to have. Their corresponding functions take the same parameters, plus a fourth value in the range 0–1 — which sets the transparency, or alpha channel. 0 is completely transparent, and 1 is completely opaque.

Let's show another quick example — first the HTML: <br>Transparent colors are very useful for richer visual effects — blending of backgrounds, semi-transparent UI elements, etc.</p>
                
<h3 id="opacity">Opacity</h3>
<p>There is another way to specify transparency via CSS — the opacity property. Instead of setting the transparency of a particular color, this sets the transparency of all selected elements and their children. Again, let's study an example so we can see the difference.<br>Note the difference — the first box that uses the RGBA color only has a semi-transparent background, whereas everything in the second box is transparent, including the text. You'll want to think carefully about when to use each — for example RGBA is useful when you want to create an overlaid image caption where the image shows through the caption box but the text is still readable. Opacity, on the other hand, is useful when you want to create an animation effect where a whole UI element goes from completely visible to hidden.</p>
                
<h2 id="functions">Functions</h2>
<p>In programming, a function is a reusable section of code that can be run multiple times to complete a repetitive task with minimum effort on the part of both the developer and the computer. Functions are usually associated with languages like JavaScript, Python, or C++, but they do exist in CSS too, as property values. We've already seen functions in action in the Colors section, with rgb(), hsl(), etc.:</p>
<br>background-color: rgba(255,0,0,0.5);
<br>background-color: hsla(240,100%,50%,0.5);
<br>These functions calculate what color to use.

<p>But you'll see functions in other places too — anytime you see a name with parenthesis after it, containing one or more values separated by commas, you are dealing with a function. For example:
                
<br>One of the more common CSS functions is the url() function notation, which returns a file; generally an image as seen above. There are several image functions, including ones to create linear, radial, and conic gradients.

<br>There are many exciting bits of functionality to use within CSS, which you'll learn about in due course! </p>

 <section class="main-section" id="css_cascade">
<header><h1>The Cascade</h1></header>         
 <p>CSS is an abbreviation for Cascading Style Sheets, which indicates that the notion of the cascade is important. At its most basic level, it indicates that the order of CSS rules matter, but it's more complex than that. What selectors win out in the cascade depends on three factors (these are listed in order of weight — earlier ones will overrule later ones):<ul>
<li>Importance</li>
<li>Specificity</li>
<li>Source order</li>
     </ul>  
<h2 id="importance">Importance</h2>
<p>In CSS, there is a special piece of syntax you can use to make sure that a certain declaration will always win over all others: !important.

Let's look at an example: 
<br>It is useful to know that !important exists so that you know what it is when you come across it in other people's code. However, we strongly recommend that you never use it unless you absolutely have to. One situation in which you may have to use it is when you are working on a CMS where you can't edit the core CSS modules, and you really want to override a style that can't be overridden in any other way. But really, don't use it if you can avoid it, because !important changes the way the cascade normally works, so it can make debugging CSS problems really hard to work out, especially in a large stylesheet.

<br>It is also useful to note that the importance of a CSS declaration depends on what stylesheet it is specified in — it is possible for users to set custom stylesheets to override the developer's styles, for example the user might be visually impaired, and want to set the font size on all web pages they visit to be double the normal size to allow for easier reading.
<br>
<ol> Conflicting declarations will be applied in the following order, with later ones overriding earlier ones:

<li>Declarations in user agent style sheets (e.g. the browser's default styles, used when no other styling is set).</li>
<li>Normal declarations in user style sheets (custom styles set by a user).</li>
<li>Normal declarations in author style sheets (these are the styles set by us, the web developers).</li>
<li>Important declarations in author style sheets</li>
<li>Important declarations in user style sheets</li></ol>
<br>
It makes sense for web developers' stylesheets to override user stylesheets, so the design can be kept as intended, but sometimes users have good reasons to override web developer styles, as mentioned above — this can be achieved by using !important in their rules.

<h2 id="specificity">Specificity</h2>
<p>Specificity is basically a measure of how specific a selector is — how many elements it could match. As shown in the example seen above, element selectors have low specificity. Class selectors have a higher specificity, so will win against element selectors. ID selectors have an even higher specificity, so will win against class selectors. The only way to win against an ID selector is to use !important.</p>
<br>
<ol> The amount of specificity a selector has is measured using four different values (or components), which can be thought of as thousands, hundreds, tens and ones — four single digits in four columns:
<br>
<li><strong>Thousands:</strong> Score one in this column if the declaration is inside a style attribute, aka inline styles. Such declarations don't have selectors, so their specificity is always simply 1000.</li>
<li><strong>Hundreds:</strong> Score one in this column for each ID selector contained inside the overall selector.</li>
<li><strong>Tens:</strong> Score one in this column for each class selector, attribute selector, or pseudo-class contained inside the overall selector.</li>
<li><strong>Ones:</strong>strong> Score one in this column for each element selector or pseudo-element contained inside the overall selector.</li>
    </ol> 
            
<h2 id="inheritance">Inheritance</h2>
<p>CSS inheritance is the last piece we need to investigate to get all the information and understand what style is applied to an element. The idea is that some property values applied to an element will be inherited by that element's children, and some won't.

<br>For example, it makes sense for font-family and color to be inherited, as that makes it easy for you to set a site-wide base font by applying a font-family to the html element; you can then override the fonts on individual elements where needed. It would be really annoying to have to set the base font separately on every element.
<br>As another example, it makes sense for margin, padding, border, and background-image to NOT be inherited. Imagine the styling/layout mess that would occur if you set these properties on a container element and had them inherited by every single child element, and then had to unset them all on each individual element!
Which properties are inherited by default and which aren't is largely down to common sense. If you want to be sure, however, you can consult the CSS Reference — each separate property page contains a summary table including various details about that element, including whether it is inherited or not.

<h2 id="controlling_inheritance">Controlling inheritance</h2>
<p>CSS provides four special universal property values for specifying inheritance:

<p><strong>inherit</strong>
Sets the property value applied to a selected element to be the same as that of its parent element.</p>
<p><strong>initial</strong>
Sets the property value applied to a selected element to be the same as the value set for that element in the browser's default style sheet. If no value is set by the browser's default style sheet and the property is naturally inherited, then the property value is set to inherit instead.</p>
<p><strong>unset</strong>
Resets the property to its natural value, which means that if the property is naturally inherited it acts like inherit, otherwise it acts like initial.</p>
<p><strong>revert</strong>

<p>Reverts the property to the value it would have had if the current origin had not applied any styles to it. In other words, the property's value is set to the user stylesheet's value for the property (if one is set), otherwise, the property's value is taken from the user agent's default stylesheet.</p>
      <br>

<section class="main-section" id="box_model">
<header><h1>CSS Box Model</h1></header>
<p>The CSS box model is the foundation of layout on the Web — each element is represented as a rectangular box, with the box's content, padding, border, and margin built up around one another like the layers of an onion. As a browser renders a web page layout, it works out what styles are applied to the content of each box, how big the surrounding onion layers are, and where the boxes sit in relation to one another. Before understanding how to create CSS layouts, you need to understand the box model — this is what we'll look at in this article.</p>
    
<h2 id="box_properties">Box properties</h2>
<p>Every element within a document is structured as a rectangular box inside the document layout, the size and "onion layers" of which can be tweaked using some specific CSS properties. The relevant properties are as follows:</p>
            
<h3>width and height</h3>
<p>The width and height properties set the width and height of the content box, which is the area in which the content of the box is displayed — this content includes both text content set inside the box, and other boxes representing nested child elements.</p>   
<h3>padding</h3>
<p>Padding refers to the inner margin of a CSS box — between the outer edge of the content box and the inner edge of the border. The size of this layer can be set on all four sides at once with the padding shorthand property, or one side at a time with the padding-top, padding-right, padding-bottom and padding-left properties.</p>
<h3>border</h3>
<p>The border of a CSS box sits between the outer edge of the padding and the inner edge of the margin. By default the border has a size of 0 — making it invisible — but you can set the thickness, style and color of the border to make it appear. The border shorthand property allows you to set all of these on all four sides at once, for example border: 1px solid black. This can be broken down into numerous different longhand properties for more specific styling needs:
border-top, border-right, border-bottom, border-left: Set the thickness, style and color of one side of the border.
border-width, border-style, border-color: Set only the thickness, style, or color individually, but for all four sides of the border.
You can also set one of the three properties of a single side of the border individually, using border-top-width, border-top-style, border-top-color, etc. </p>
<h3>margin</h3>
<p>The margin surrounds a CSS box, and pushes up against other CSS boxes in the layout. It behaves rather like padding; the shorthand property is margin and the individual properties are margin-top, margin-right, margin-bottom, and margin-left.</p>

<h4>Some hints and ideas:</h4>
    <ol>
<li>By default background-color/background-image extend to the edge of the border. This behaviour can be changed using the background-clip property, which you'll learn about in the Background_clip section.</li>
<li>If the content box becomes larger than the example output window, it will overflow out of the window, and scroll bars will appear to allow you to scroll the window to view the rest of the box. You can control overflow with the overflow property — see also the Overflow section below.</li>
<li>Box heights don't observe percentage lengths; box height always adopts the height of the box content, unless a specific absolute height is set (e.g. pixels or ems.) This is more convenient than the height of every box on your page defaulting to 100% of the viewport height.</li>
<li>Borders ignore percentage width settings too.
You should have noticed that the total width of a box is the sum of its width, padding-right, padding-left, border-right, and border-left properties. In some cases it is annoying (for example, what if you want to have a box with a total width of 50% with border and padding expressed in pixels?) To avoid such problems, it's possible to tweak the box model with the property box-sizing. With the value border-box, it changes the box model to this new one:</li>
            </ol>
<h2 id="types_of_boxes">Types of CSS boxes</h2>
<p>Everything we've said so far applies to boxes that represent block level elements. However, CSS has other types of boxes that behave differently. The type of box applied to an element is specified by the display property. There are many different values available for display, but in this article we will focus on the three most common ones; <strong>block, inline, and inline-block.</strong>

<p><strong>A block box</strong> is defined as a box that's stacked upon other boxes (i.e. content before and after the box appears on a separate line), and can have width and height set on it. The whole box model as described above applies to block boxes.</p>
    
<p><strong>An inline box</strong> is the opposite of a block box: it flows with the document's text (i.e. it will appear on the same line as surrounding text and other inline elements, and its content will break with the flow of the text, like lines of text in a paragraph.) Width and height settings have no effect on inline boxes; any padding, margin and border set on inline boxes will update the position of surrounding text, but will not affect the position of surrounding block boxes.</p>
    
<p><strong>An inline-block box</strong> is something in between the first two: It flows with surrounding text and other inline elements without creating line breaks before and after it unlike a block box, but it can be sized using width and height and maintains its block integrity like a block box. It won't be broken across paragraph lines like an inline box. In the below example the inline-block box goes onto the 2nd line of text while keeping the shape of a box as there is not enough space for it on the first line, whereas inline box does break on multiple lines if there is not enough space — it loses the shape of a box.</p>
